It was important. Today was perfect,\" City manager Pep Guardiola told TNT Sport.\n\n\"They were patient in the right moments. Really good. I'm really proud of the team. The third goal helped us a lot. Hopefully we can finish it off at home and go to the next game.\n\n\"It was important to not lose the tie here. The game was really well played from the first minute.\n\n\"We conceded a goal but sometimes that happens. In the second half they played with five in the back but in general we did well. We didn't concede transitions or make the crowd support the team. We had the perfect tempo so really pleased.\"\n\nDe Bruyne was once again influential for City having hit the ground running since he returned from injury. \n\n\"We've played here a couple of times, the atmosphere is great and you know they're going to try and do everything. They had a great group stage so we have to respect them,\" De Bruyne told TNT Sport.\n\nThe Belgian may have been happy to give FC Copenhagen credit but he still believed that his side should have been more effective in front of goal.\n\n\"I think in the second half we created many chances and I think we could have scored more. Luckily in the end we scored the third one so it's a little bit of an advantage now,\" De Bruyne said.\n\nMeanwhile Foden was quick to heap praise on his teammate\n\n\"Me and Kevin [de Bruyne] have built that connection now so we know where we're running. He's such an important player for us,\" Foden told TNT Sport.  \n\n\"When teams play in a low block you need runners in behind. Kevin knows the right time to make that movement and it makes my job easier. For me, there's no better player in the world at passing the ball. He's a pleasure to play with and so important.\n\n\"It's a special group. I enjoy being here every day. There's so much hunger. When you have that determination it goes a long way.\"\n\nThe two sides meet in the second leg at the Etihad Stadium on March 6."}]}

Lunin played a great game, the best game.\n\n\"We were dangerous in transitions, we could have scored more but we could also have tied. This is a small advantage.\"\n\nIn a lively start the home side thought they had gone ahead when striker Benjamin Sesko headed in after three minutes. His effort though was disallowed following a VAR review.\n\nThe Slovenian had another chance before Real gradually brought some balance to the game and came close themselves through Rodrygo, making his 200th appearance for the club.\n\nLeipzig were again more aggressive after half-time but the home crowd was silenced when Real struck on the break.\n\nDiaz picked up the ball near the sideline, shook off three players, cut in towards the box and curled a superb shot past keeper P\u00e9ter Gul\u00e1csi.\n\nThe hosts almost drew level two minutes later but Lunin stopped a Dani Olmo shot before blocking Sesko's rebound effort.\n\nWith Leipzig taking more risks in search of an equaliser, Madrid, waiting to break, found openings and almost scored again when Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior flicked the ball onto the post in the 72nd.\n\nLunin was kept busy throughout the second half and did well to deny Sesko and Olmo again before also keeping out substitute Amadou Haidara's effort late in the game.\n\n\"In the end it was a great solo effort that decided the game,\" Leipzig's Gulacsi said. \"It is frustrating for us because we played well and were not the worse team of the two. It was an open game in the second half and we had our chances.\"\n\nMadrid were missing several players through injury, including in-form attacking midfielder Bellingham and keeper Thibaut Courtois.

Their 17 shots were the most by a team that failed to record a shot on target in a Champions League game since 2010-11.\n\nThe Bavarians, favourites going into the game, were desperate to bounce back from Saturday's 3-0 Bundesliga loss to leaders Bayer Leverkusen which left them five points off the top.\n\nThey will return to Munich with more pressure piling on coach Thomas Tuchel and his team after their second straight defeat. They have failed to score in their last two games.\n\n\"We started well had a chance in the first minute and then with Harry Kane and then with Jamal Musiala. We had the game under control in the first half,\" Tuchel said.\n\n\"But in the second our performance dropped inexplicably. We made too many individual errors and made our opponents stronger and we lost concentration. We lost our rhythm.\n\n\"It was completely our responsibility. We lost a game today that in the first half looked like we could not lose it.\"\n\nTuchel played down concerns about his situation.\n\n\"Worried about my future? No I am not,\" he said.\n\nBayern started well and pressed the Italians high to create early chances for Joshua Kimmich and Kane, who both narrowly missed the target.\n\nThe Italians, who had lost 6-2 on aggregate to Bayern at this stage three years ago, responded with a Luis Alberto missile that flew wide of Manuel Neuer's goal.\n\nThe tempo gradually dropped, Bayern struggled with the disciplined Italian back line and had to wait until the 40th minute to threaten again with Musiala firing over the bar from close range.\n\nLazio should have taken the lead two minutes after the restart when Isaksen only had Neuer to beat but the keeper stood his ground to block his shot.\n\nThe Dane earned a penalty when Immobile passed to Isaksen in the box and Upamecano arrived late and stepped on his ankle.\n\nImmobile kept his cool and sent Neuer the wrong way to give his team the advantage going into the return leg in Munich on March 5.\n\n\"We worked and prepared for this match to have a say in it,\" said Immobile. \"I was convinced that the team would put everything out there.\n\n\"We had some opportunities and we had to be good at exploiting them ahead of the return match and we did just that.\"\n\nBayern condemned racist comments sent to Upamecano on social media following his dismissal. Numerous racist comments were left on the defender's Instagram account.\n\n\"FC Bayern strongly condemn the racist comments being directed towards Dayot Upamecano on social media. Anyone who comments hateful words such as these is no fan of our club. We're all behind you, Upa!\" Bayern posted on X, formerly Twitter."}]}

We spoke to each other at halftime and the coach [Luis Enrique] pulled our strings. He was really upset,\" PSG captain Marquinhos told Canal Plus.\n\n\"Our attitude was much better in the second half. He [Enrique] always tells us the truth, and that's very important for the team.\n\n\"He gave us some advice ... and that worked well in the second half. The first part of our objective has been achieved. It's important to win at home.\"\n\nPSG were lucky to go into the break with the match scoreless as Real Sociedad's captain Mikel Merino unleashed a thunderous strike that exploded off the crossbar just before halftime.\n\nA resilient Mbapp\u00e9, who missed his club's previous match due to an ankle injury, took advantage of Real Sociedad being temporarily down to 10-men after defender Hamari Traor\u00e9 was on the sidelines receiving medical treatment.\n\nMbapp\u00e9's strike into the the top corner sparked wild celebrations among the Parc des Princes crowd and the Frenchman almost extended PSG's lead a little later but his thunderous effort was tipped away by Remiro.\n\n\"We managed to score at key moments in the game. We have a good lead,\" Mbapp\u00e9 told Canal Plus.\n\n\"The clean sheet is important for us, we've been looking for that in the Champions League, although it's true that they [Sociedad] have not not been scoring much at the moment.\n\n\"It's evident that we had trouble getting out of their pressing game in the first half. We should have shown more character to get out of it, as we were eight [players] against six.\n\n\"The return leg will be more open, they will attack more and we will be given more space. If we get the space over 40 meters, I think we will score over there.\"\n\nBarcola extended PSG's lead in the 70th minute with a fine individual display as he burst through from the halfway line to net a tidy finish.\n\nPSG had more chances to score but the visitors held on and will have a tough task to fight back from two goals down in the return leg in Spain on March 5."}]}

The lads were wonderful against a physical, technical side that did not make it at all easy,\" Inter manager Simone Inzaghi told Sky Sport Italia.\n\nThe return fixture is on March 13 in the Spanish capital.\n\n\"We know this is only the first leg, the second match will be tough, and certainly there are regrets for the result considering with all that we created, we deserved a wider scoreline. This is football, we keep going,\" Inzaghi added.\n\nInter wore black armbands as their fans at San Siro paid tribute to the club's former player Germany World Cup-winner Andreas Brehme, who died at 63 earlier on Tuesday.\n\nInter dominated the match and although Atletico had their chances the home side's solid defence prevented the visitors from getting any attempts on target.\n\nSamuel Lino had Atletico's first opportunity but his right-footed curler went just wide of the far post.\n\nAhead of the interval Martinez and Thuram had openings to break the deadlock for Inter but also came up against a resilient defence, with attempts blocked or saved by Oblak.\n\nInter started the second half on the attack as Federico Dimarco supplied a cross to Arnautovic, who slid in slightly late and ballooned the ball over from close range.\n\nJust after the hour the home fans again expressed their frustration as Arnautovic, having found himself free in front of goal, sent another effort over the crossbar before the villain became the hero of the night with his late winning goal.\n\n\"The third chance came after I missed a couple and I'm happy to have scored for the people who came here to cheer as well as for my teammates and for my family, who were here tonight,\" Arnautovic told Mediaset.\n\nDespite the late win it was also a night of concern for Inzaghi as Frenchman Thuram, a pivotal player this season, was substituted at the break, seemingly struggling with a leg injury.\n\nThe 26-year-old has made a significant contribution this term with 12 goals and 11 assists in all competitions.\n\n\"He will have tests and we hope that we won't lose him for long,\" said Inzaghi."}]}

I saw a very beatable Eindhoven today.\n\n\"We were not good enough with the ball. In our home game, we simply need to play better with the ball. Then, I am very confident we will progress.\"\n\nThe match was PSV's first Champions League knockout tie in eight seasons as they bid to reach the quarter-finals for the first time since the 2006-07 campaign.\n\nIt was a game of few clearcut chances as neither side committed too much in attack in a cagey contest.\n\nMalik Tillman had an excellent chance for the opener when he was teed up on the edge of the box and, as the Dortmund defence parted in front of him, dragged his shot wide.\n\nDortmund took the lead with a wonderful strike from Malen, who had four successful years at PSV before moving to the Bundesliga in 2021.\n\nMalen appeared to be crowded out by two home defenders but managed to get a powerful shot away from 14 yards which took a slight deflection and beat keeper Walter Benitez as it went in off the crossbar.\n\nPSV were awarded a penalty by referee Srdjan Jovanovic early in the second half when Dortmund defender Mats Hummels lunged in on Tillman.\n\nHummels got a healthy touch to the ball before making contact with the German-born United States international, but the VAR confirmed the on-field decision, much to the visitors' dismay.\n\nDe Jong easily finished from 12 yards to create a small bit of club history as in doing so he overtook Ruud van Nistelrooy as PSV's leading scorer in the Champions League with nine goals."}]}

We can do better.\n\n\"If you want to be in the quarterfinals you have to beat your opponent, and this is what we will have to do at the Emirates now.\"\n\nReassuringly for Arsenal, Porto have a terrible record away against English clubs and have never scored at Arsenal, conceding 11 in three visits.\n\nBut the 30-time Portuguese champions will travel with hope.\n\nArteta's side controlled possession throughout the game. But apart from a couple of headers from William Saliba and Kai Havertz, both from corners, never really looked like scoring.\n\nPorto grew in confidence after an incredible incident in the 21st minute when Galeno thumped a shot against the far post and, when the ball came back to him at pace, he placed the rebound agonisingly wide of the other post.\n\nWith 40-year-old Pep\u00ea, the oldest player to appear in a Champions League knockout round game, showing his vast experience at the back, Porto comfortably dealt with Arsenal's goal threats and England forward Bukayo Saka was very quiet.\n\nPorto occasionally threatened and had another chance shortly before the break when Evanilson drove a shot at Raya.\n\nThe second half was even less exciting than the first with Arsenal struggling to gain any rhythm against their wily hosts.\n\nBut the best was saved to last as Galeno seized on a loose ball and advanced to the edge of the penalty area before looking up and bending a shot past Raya.\n\n\"It was a kick in the teeth,\" Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice said. \"We have to change our approach in the home leg and give it absolutely everything.\""}]}

He received a pass from Pedri just inside the box and made space to unleash a bullet strike into the bottom corner of the net.\n\n\"We have a lot of work to do, but I congratulated the team for rediscovering the desire to fight,\" Calzona told Amazon Prime Video Italia. \"We struggled at the start but I really liked the spirit of the side.

He was virtually unstoppable down left channel, and Tuesday's brace means he has scored 11 of PSG's past 15 Champions League knockout goals.\n\n\"We knew right away that we couldn't go to sleep,\" Mbappe told Canal Plus. \"If they had opened the scoring, they would have pushed on with their fans' backing.\n\n\"We had to dampen their hopes early on. That's what we did, and we're very happy to be back in the quarterfinals.\"\n\nMbapp\u00e9 created a couple of opportunities early on before scoring the opener with a fabulous curling strike in the 15th minute.\n\nAfter receiving a long pass from Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, he surged into the box, darting in from the byline and feigning to shoot, before shifting the ball out of his feet again and creating just enough space to fire a curling effort into the far corner.\n\nThe goal silenced a sold-out Reale Arena, who were seemingly stunned by the vision and technique of the France captain, who had a similar effort later denied by keeper \u00c1lex Remiro.\n\nBut Mbapp\u00e9 scored again in the 56th minute as he took a Lee Kang-in through ball in his stride before bursting into the box and beating the goalkeeper at his near post.\n\nPSG seemed content to sit back against a tame Real Sociedad who carried little threat for most of the game.\n\nThey tried to make a late push, but were first denied by the post from a Mart\u00edn Zubimendi strike and then by keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who made a fine reflex save to deny Be\u00f1at Turrientes from close range.\n\nMikel Merino finally netted a consolation goal in the 89th minute with a deflected strike, but it was too little too late to prevent PSG reaching the Champions League quarterfinals for the first time in three years."}]}

It was a big game,\" said Kane, who has scored six goals for Bayern in the competition and another 27 in the Bundesliga this season. \"We were 1-0 down in the first leg. It's obviously a big moment in our season. It was a top performance.\n\n\"Of course we know we have to improve, but nights like this can really change the season. I'm really proud of the boys and we just have to keep this momentum going.\"\n\nLazio were on the backfoot from the start and waited to hit the Germans on the break.\n\nCiro Immobile's header was their best chance but it sailed narrowly wide a minute before Kane bagged his first knockout stage goal in the competition in five years with a diving header.\n\nThe Italians, bidding for their first quarterfinal spot in 24 years, had succeeded for half an hour in keeping Bayern outside the box but could do nothing when Kane, who had missed an earlier chance, headed in from teammate Rapha\u00ebl Guerreiro's miskick.\n\nJamal Musiala almost added another seconds later but his sliding shot just missed the target before Thomas Mueller headed in a Matthijs de Ligt volley on the stroke of halftime.\n\nKane now has 27 Champions League goals, with Wayne Rooney the only Englishman to have scored more in the competition (30).\n\nThe former Tottenham Hotspur striker killed off any hopes of an Italian comeback in the 68th, tapping in on the rebound after Leroy San\u00e9's shot was palmed into his path.\n\nThe Bavarians refused to step off the gas and Muller almost scored a second himself, but keeper Ivan Provedel tipped his shot onto the post in the 71st.\n\nBayern have now made it to at least the final eight in 12 of the last 13 campaigns."}]}

But Real Madrid increased the tempo in the second half and ultimately did enough to seal their place in the last eight.\n\nBidding for a record-extending 15th Champions League title, Madrid took the lead thanks to a Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior strike from a counterattack in the 65th minute.\n\nBut Leipzig's Willi Orb\u00e1n levelled the score three minutes later with a header to set up a tense final few minutes that included a strike that hit the crossbar by Dani Olmo.\n\nEven though Madrid have a formidable record in Europe, having been knocked out in the round of 16 only twice in the past 14 years while winning the title five times during that period, Carlo Ancelotti's team began rather cagily.\n\nLeipzig kept threatening to score, with Orban missing twice in the second half after shooting wide.\n\nIn the second half, Rodrygo replaced Eduardo Camavinga and suddenly Real were playing with more purpose.\n\nReal appeared to have put the tie to bed when Toni Kroos stole the ball and fed Jude Bellingham at the halfway line, who took the ball up the Leipzig box.\n\nHe slipped a pass to Vin\u00edcius, who had cut in from the left into the centre circle before rifling a shot into the left-hand corner.\n\nThat goal only seemed to fire up Leipzig, who equalised within three minutes when Orban got in front of Nacho to score with a stooping header from a cross by David Raum.\n\nIn a final 20 minutes in which several yellow cards were handed out, Real were playing with fire and were under repeated pressure in their own box with goalkeeper Andriy Lunin, who had already saved Real in the first leg, forced to make several crucial saves.\n\nLeipzig almost took the game to extra time when Dani Olmo saw his shot ricochet off the bar in added time.\n\nUltimately, Real did just enough to qualify for yet another quarterfinal.\n\n\"Obviously we know it wasn\u00b4t the best game of the season,\" Real captain Nacho said.\n\n\"Sometimes you just have bad games and tonight was the case. It looks like a drama because of how we played, but what really matters is we qualified for the quarters. Let that be a lesson for what's to come.\""}]}

We play on Sunday. So I need fresh legs.\"\n\nCity are a point behind Liverpool and a point ahead of Arsenal after 27 league games in tight title race. They are also in the thick of the FA Cup, with a quarter-final against Newcastle United on March 16.\n\n\"To be part of the titles, we need everyone,\" Guardiola said. \"For one more year we are in the best eight teams in Europe. Incredibly happy we are still in all competitions.\"\n\nAkanji scored with City's first chance, volleying in Alvarez's corner in the fifth minute.\n\n\"I saw the ball coming. It was perfect for my foot,\" Akanji told TNT. \"I was really happy about it. It was our aim to score early. The first two goals in the first half made it easier for us. We tried to do our best and did what we had to do.\"\n\n\u00c1lvarez scored his own four minutes later, thanks to calamitous goalkeeping by Kamil Grabara, who let the City forward's shot slip through his hands seconds after Rodri pinged an effort off the crossbar.\n\nFormer Southampton player Mohamed Elyounoussi pulled one back for the Danish champions in the 29th minute but City's goal-scoring machine Haaland slotted home a low, hard shot through two defenders seconds before halftime, his 29th goal of the season across all competitions.\n\nRico Lewis had a late chance for a fourth City goal but his shot hit the bar.\n\nCity joined Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain in the quarters, with the final four teams to be determined next week.\n\n\"We are a team that believes we can do it,\" Guardiola said. \"Listen, we're competing with Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. We don't know who we are going to face. It's a question of wait and see. The important thing is seven years in a row we are here.\"\n\nCity will find out their quarterfinal opponents in the draw on March 15.\n\n\"We feel good right now,\" Akanji said. \"We're confident going into the next round. We are one of the favourites but have to prove it.\"\n\nHaaland was taken off late in the game, wrapping 18-year-old substitute Jacob Wright, who made his Champions League debut, in a hug as he left the pitch.\n\nCopenhagen boss Jacob Neestrup believes City can retain their Champions League title.\n\n\"They're going to win it, they are,\" he said. \"This is just a level up -- in everything.\n\n\"We have played [City] two seasons in a row and Man City are getting better. They are top players, the structure they have is amazing. It is not just the technical and tactical. They work hard.\""}]}

I'm over the moon to save two penalties in the Champions League to get through to the quarterfinals,\" Raya said.\n\nLeandro Trossard's well-taken effort shortly before half-time had levelled the tie, but Arsenal struggled to break down a disciplined Porto side who also carved out some decent chances.\n\nExtra time failed to separate the sides, but Mikel Arteta's Arsenal held their nerve to snap a run of seven successive exits at the round-of-16 stage.\n\nThe last time Arsenal reached the quarterfinals in 2010 they also beat Porto in the last 16, and they will go into Friday's draw full of confidence that they can go further.\n\n\"For them to do it when the club hasn't done it for 14 years, that tells you the difficulty,\" Arteta, whose side has won eight successive Premier League games to edge ahead of Manchester City and Liverpool, told reporters.\n\n\"They are willing to sacrifice anything to win.\"\n\nIt was hard on Porto, who produced a classic away performance with 41-year-old defender Pep\u00ea a rock at the back and Evanilson twice going close to stunning the hosts.\n\nBut they were left with nothing to show for it as their dreadful record away to English clubs continued with a 20th defeat from 24 games.\n\nPorto's tactic of disrupting Arsenal's attacking rhythm had worked a treat in the first leg when Galeno's stoppage-time goal earned them a 1-0 win, and it proved effective again.\n\nArsenal were restricted to few clear chances in the opening period with Odegaard's shot into the side-netting a rare glimmer of their usual attacking verve.\n\nBacked by a sizable travelling support, Porto were calm and composed and occasionally threatening with Brazilian striker Evanilson forcing a fine save from Raya.\n\nWith half-time approaching, anxiety was growing among the home faithful, but the mood changed in the 41st minute when Odegaard, so often Arsenal's catalyst, slipped a pass through Porto's defence and Trossard side-footed past Diogo Costa.\n\nThe expected Arsenal siege failed to materialise in the second half, though, as Porto stuck to their script, disrupting the flow of the game with every trick in the book.\n\nArsenal's frustration boiled over at the midway point of the second half when Pepe tried to shepherd the ball back to his keeper but got in a tangle and Odegaard scored, only for the goal to be harshly ruled out for a foul by Havertz.\n\nArteta was so incensed at the decision that he received a yellow card, and not long after that Porto coach Sergio Conceicao also went into the book as the tension mounted.\n\nWith the tie on a knife edge, Arsenal's hearts were in their mouths when Francisco Concei\u00e7\u00e3o burst through and forced Raya into another save, while at the other end substitute Gabriel Jesus almost scored with his first touch as his close-range shot was saved by the legs of Costa.\n\nExtra time was a stalemate, but Arsenal prevailed in the first Champions League knockout match to go to penalties since the 2016 final between Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid."}]}

Club legend Lionel Messi left Barcelona at the end of the following season.\n\n\"Very happy, Barcelona are in the top eight in Europe. It was a well-deserved qualification, a game dominated in attack and defence but also an excellent game by Napoli,\" Barcelona coach Xavi Hernandez told Mediaset.\n\n\"Happy with the qualification and we'll see how the draw goes. Proud to be back in the quarterfinals after years.\"\n\nThe Champions League could be Barcelona's last realistic chance for a title this season. They were eliminated in the Copa del Rey and trail LaLiga leaders Real Madrid by seven points.\n\nXavi has already announced he will leave his role as manager at the end of the season.\n\nThe Barcelona boss still couldn't count on several players because of injuries, including Pedri, Frenkie de Jong and Ferran Torres.\n\nXavi played with 17-year-old Pau Cubars\u00ed as a central defender, and the teenager was named the man of the match as he helped contain Napoli's attack.\n\nBarcelona, who also started 16-year-old Lamine Yamal, became the first club in Champions League knockout stage history to start multiple players under the age of 18.\n\nIn a highly entertaining affair at Montjuic Stadium, Barca pressed high early on, giving Napoli little time to settle, and the few attacks the visitors managed to create ended with striker Victor Osimhen offside.\n\nThe opening goal came when Cancelo played in Raphinha down the left wing and he cut into the area and pulled a ball back which Lewandowski let run to the unmarked Fermin who calmly slotted his shot into the bottom left corner.\n\nNapoli had little time to recover before Barca doubled their lead. The visitors pushed forward in search of an equaliser and Barcelona countered with pace.\n\nThe excellent Yamal's cross-field pass found Raphinha who cut into the area and wrong-footed Giovanni Di Lorenzo before curling a shot which came back off the far post and Cancelo was there to drive his first time effort into the net.\n\n\"There is disappointment, because we came here to try to win and we didn't succeed,\" Napoli manager Francesco Calzona said.\n\n\"We got off to a very bad start, if you concede so much to this team in the long run you lose it.\"\n\nNapoli finally found a way through on the half hour when Matteo Politano went past Cancelo in the area before playing the ball back to Rrahmani whose run from the back was rewarded with a sidefooted shot past goalkeeper Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen.\n\nVisiting keeper Alex Meret kept Napoli in the tie with a couple of great saves after the break from Lewandowski and Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, but could do nothing about the final goal.\n\nLewandowski fashioned a neat one-two with G\u00fcndogan who played the ball in to Sergi Roberto and his quick pass found the Polish striker for a simple tap-in to kill off Napoli's hopes.\n\nMinutes earlier Napoli had their best chance to level but Jesper Lindstrom headed just wide and the Italian champions go out after reaching the quarterfinals last season for the first time.\n\nThe draw for the quarterfinals will take place on Friday, with Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester City and Arsenal the other teams to have already claimed their place.\n\nNapoli's defeat ensured Juventus advanced through a European ranking system to qualify for the revamped FIFA Club World Cup in 2025."}]}

Nicol\u00f2 Barella received the ball in the area and pulled it back to the waiting Dimarco, who drove his shot straight down the middle past Oblak.\n\nAtletico, now 2-0 down on aggregate, hit back immediately. Koke lifted a pass into the area which two Inter players missed completely and it fell to Griezmann, who spun and made no mistake from close range.\n\nShortly before the break Griezmann was almost in again, but his shot was deflected away by Benjamin Pavard with Sommer committed the other way and the sides went in level at the break.\n\nMartinez set up two great chances for Inter to finish off the tie, but Marcus Thuram and Barella failed to take advantage when through on goal.\n\nThey were made to pay as Koke was again the provider, as his pass into the box found Depay who turned and powered his shot to the bottom corner.\n\nAtletico could have won it before extra time when Griezmann's pass set up Rodrigo Riquelme, but he sent his first-time shot over the bar to leave Simeone face down on the sidelines in disbelief.\n\nThe hosts made the most of the penalty shootout and the stadium erupted as Simeone was brought to tears after beating his former club and ex-team mate Simone Inzaghi."}]}

Unfortunately, in the second half, we stopped playing like that but defended with passion.\"\n\nEindhoven, who last reached the quarterfinals in 2007, improved after the break and substitute Hirving Lozano rattled the post with a missile from 25 metres.\n\nJohan Bakayoko then dribbled past defender Mats Hummels, forcing a good save from Dortmund keeper Gregor Kobel in the 70th as Eindhoven kept pushing for an equaliser.\n\nNiclas F\u00fcllkrug thought he had settled the hosts' nerves and put the game to bed when he volleyed in a Reus free kick in the 77th but his effort was ruled offside and the Germans had to endure even more Dutch pressure.\n\nLuuk de Jong could have sent the game into extra time when he was left free in front of goal but instead of tapping in, he sent the ball wildly over the bar in stoppage time.\n\n\"I got the ball and did a one-two with [Jordan] Teze,\" De Jong said. \"But I was leaning back when I shot and it all happened so quickly. Of course, I feel that I shouldn't have missed.\"\n\nDortmund then struck with the very next move as Reus completed a quick break to seal the win."}]}

They're top of the Premier League right now so we had to dig deep at times but it's a good result and hopefully we can make the difference at home.\"\n\nPredictably, the forward who scored a record 14 goals for Tottenham in the north London derby, was booed every time he touched the ball although the England captain was hardly involved in the early exchanges.\n\nBayern, whose disappointing season now rests on trying to win the competition for a seventh time, initially looked comfortable despite having no fans inside the Emirates as punishment for crowd trouble in the previous round.\n\nBut they were undone in the 12th minute when Ben White played the ball inside to Saka who had time to pick his spot and curl a low left-footed shot beyond Manuel Neuer.\n\nWhite should have made it 2-0 soon afterwards but shot straight at Neuer and it proved costly as Arsenal's defence, so impregnable in the Premier League of late, went missing.\n\nThey carelessly lost possession in the 18th minute and Bayern punished them as Leon Goretzka slipped a perfect pass to Gnabry who clipped a finish past the on-rushing David Raya.\n\nAll Arsenal's poise vanished then as Sane was allowed to run and run before being tripped in the area by William Saliba and referee Glenn Nyberg had the simplest decision to point to the penalty spot.\n\nUp stepped Kane, and despite the whistles no one really expected him to miss as he coolly sent Raya the wrong way.\n\nThe 60,000 crowd suddenly went quiet as memories of heavy European defeats by Bayern, notably a 10-2 aggregate defeat in the last 16 in 2017, flooded back and it would have got worse but for a goal-saving tackle by White on Sane.\n\nBayern, with another former Spurs player Eric Dier impressive in defence, looked comfortable after the break.\n\nArteta sent on Trossard and Gabriel Jesus just past the midway point of the second half. They combined in the 76th minute as Jesus fed Trossard to slot a low shot inside the post.\n\nA frantic ending saw Bayern substitute Kingsley Coman strike the post from close range while Arsenal were screaming for a penalty with the last action of the game as Saka went down in the area.\n\n\"We've got a draw so the situation is clear, the winner moves on,\" Bayern boss Thomas Tuchel said.\n\n\"We need the same devotion, passion and quality as we had tonight -- and we'll get through.\"\n\nThe game was played despite multiple social media posts from the Al-Azaim Foundation -- a media arm of ISIS-K -- calling for attacks at stadiums hosting Champions League quarterfinal matches. European football's governing body, UEFA, said it was aware of the threats, but that the matches would proceed as planned."}]}

But Rodrygo misfired twice from the edge of the box late in the first half and then Vinicius blasted a close-range strike over the bar early in the second half.\n\nCity piled on the pressure and levelled in the 66th minute through a stunning Phil Foden strike into the top corner and went ahead when Josko Gvardiol fired home five minutes later with an equally sublime finish.\n\nBut Federico Valverde's glorious volley in the 79th rescued a draw for Real on another epic Champions League night that left the fans eager for more in the return leg in Manchester.\n\n\"[The equaliser] lifts your spirits a bit for the return leg,\" Valverde said after the match. \"A draw is a bit like last year, it feels like a defeat.\n\n\"The most important thing is we knew how to respond to the goal, scoring twice in a few minutes, that motivated us. Then we rested a bit and that wasn't good, we stopped pressing a bit due to tiredness and they have good players.\n\n\"We both played a great game.\"\n\nThe game was played despite multiple social media posts from the Al-Azaim Foundation -- a media arm of ISIS-K -- calling for attacks at stadiums hosting Champions League quarterfinal matches.\n\nEuropean football's governing body, UEFA, said it was aware of the threats, but that the matches would proceed as planned.\n\nIt is the third consecutive encounter between the clubs in the knockout stages of the Champions League. Madrid eliminated City in the semifinals in 2022, while City got the best of Madrid at the same stage last year. Both teams went on to win the title after eliminating their rivals.\n\nThe game also marked Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti's 200th game in the dugout in the Champions League. The 64-year-old Italian has the most appearances as coach in the European tournament, as well as the most titles (four) and victories (114).\n\nMan City coach Pep Guardiola entered the match at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium with the second most Champions League victories as a coach, with 109 wins in 168 appearances.\n\nThe second leg will be played at The Etihad on April 17, with a spot in the semifinals on the line.\n\n\"I'd rather play the second leg at home than at the Bernabeu, with past experience,\" Guardiola said. \"But favourites? Against the kings of this competition? No, the favourites will be those who play best, but our fans will help us for sure.\"\n\nGuardiola left playmaker Kevin De Bruyne out of his starting lineup after the Belgian felt sick in the locker room prior to the match.\n\n\"When we arrived here in the locker room ... He started to vomit when we arrived and he didn't feel good to play,\" Guardiola said. \"The secret at the high level is to adapt.\""}]}

It's a shame about the goal we conceded and that feeling of being behind defending.\n\n\"There were moments when we could have scored a third but the truth is that we have suffered a lot in the second half.\"\n\n\"But it's a very important to win. Now we need to go there and hopefully we can win. We know we have the level to reach the semis, we have demonstrated that on the pitch,\" added the France international.\n\nOnly three minutes later Kobel pulled off a sensational one-handed save to push Axel Witsel's backheel flick over the bar but the Germans were seriously struggling to get the ball out of their own half.\n\nTheir best chance was a low show by Maatsen that Atl\u00e9tico keeper Jan Oblak pushed wide.\n\nThe LaLiga side scored again courtesy of another defensive blunder as Samuel Lino, who will miss the return leg next week after being booked, doubled their lead in the 32nd from a Griezmann assist.\n\nThe introduction of Julian Brandt after the break instantly gave Dortmund more punch up front but Lino forced another superb Kobel save in the 75th front before S\u00e9bastien Haller cut the deficit in the 81st minute to improve the Germans' odds going into next Tuesday's return leg.\n\nDefender Mats Hummels, making his 500th appearance for Dortmund, then kept them in the game, slid in to stop \u00c1ngel Correa.\n\nThe Bundesliga side missed two chances to equalise late in the game, with Jamie Bynoe-Gittens' deflected shot in the 87th bouncing off the crossbar and Brandt's last-gasp header also hitting the woodwork in stoppage time.\n\n\"Everything remains open,\" said Dortmund coach Edin Terzic. \"The first 30 minutes were not good enough. Often, at this level, it's already over if you make so many mistakes. But we didn't accept that and still managed to show what we're capable of.\"\n\n\"We made too many mistakes. In the end, a draw wouldn't have been undeserved. Now we look forward to what's coming in six days. Today, we felt what they want and now we know what we have to do at home,\" he added.\n\nSecurity had been tightened around the Metropolitano stadium following a threat of attacks by the resurgent Islamic State militant group with hundreds of officers inside and outside the stadium."}]}

Congratulations to the opponent, we competed as well as we can, now we focus on LaLiga.\n\n\"They were better, and when a team is better you have to congratulate them.\"\n\nThe home fans had barely retaken their seats following that goal when Sabitzer popped up on the edge of the box, steadying himself with an excellent first touch before drilling home the winner in front of an ecstatic crowd three minutes later.\n\n\"It was a great game for everyone who came to the stadium. We played a great first half, it took us five or 10 minutes (to get going) in the second half, we have to accept that, but the answer to that [the Atletico goals] was sensational,\" goal-scorer Brandt said."}]}

Bringing in Bradley Barcola up front was crucial as the France winger was a constant menace to Barca's defence, running up and down the left channel as PSG dominated from the start.\n\nBut Barcelona seemed comfortable to sit back and counterattack, with Raphinha giving them the lead in the 12th minute.\n\nTeenager Lamine Yamal took a long pass in his stride before slicing past Nuno Mendes in the right channel and putting the ball on a plate for the Brazilian to score the opener.\n\nBar\u00e7a then wasted a chance to extend their lead when Robert Lewandowski missed from close range and were down to 10 men just before the half hour after last man Ronald Ara\u00fajo was shown a red card for a foul on Barcola just outside the penalty area.\n\nThe Uruguay defender and his Bar\u00e7a teammates argued with the referee, saying it was a shoulder charge and Pau Cubars\u00ed was close by and ready to challenge Barcola, but it was in vain and Araujo eventually made his way off the field.\n\nFormer Barcelona forward Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 put the resulting free kick just wide but did not miss the target nine minutes later, firing home for the visitors in the 40th to equalise on the night from another great play by Barcola.\n\nPSG were back on top in the second half and piled on the pressure until Vitinha finally managed to put the visitors in front on the night after 54 minutes.\n\nBarcelona coach Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez was sent off for complaining to the officials in the 56th minute.\n\nDembele played a short corner to Achraf Hakimi, who rolled a pass to Vitinha just outside the area, and the Portuguese midfielder had all the time in the world to slot a shot just inside Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen's right-hand post.\n\nPSG kept up the pressure, and in the 61st minute Bar\u00e7a full-back Jo\u00e3o Cancelo made a reckless sliding tackle to take down Dembele and concede a penalty that Mbapp\u00e9 fired into the top corner to make it 3-1 as PSG moved ahead in the tie.\n\nAs Bar\u00e7a tried to find a goal to take the game to extra time, France striker Mbapp\u00e9 made the most of a counterattack to score from close range and wrap up a semifinal place.\n\n\"Everyone believed in it. We didn't give up,\" Dembele told Canal+. \"We knew we were going to score goals. It was great work from the whole team. The coach's tactics were perfect. We made a great effort after conceding the first goal.\n\n\"Qualifying for the semifinal is a big thing. We're crossing our fingers to make it to the final. We'll have to recover well.\""}]}

It's been a tough season for us and we've had to fight and grind at times,\" Bayern's top scorer Harry Kane, who had bagged a goal in the first leg, said.\n\n\"Today was just that -- we knew it was going to be a tough game but also that at home we could make the difference with our fans there.\n\n\"As always in these types of games, the first half was a bit cagey. We said at half-time to up the tempo and the pressing and be better with the ball. That's what we did.\"\n\nThere was little to separate the two sides in a cautious first half with Bayern threatening early with two shots from Kane.\n\nArsenal, bidding to reach the semifinals for the first time since 2009, were almost caught on the break in the 23rd minute when Noussair Mazraoui's cutback after a quick turn of pace was palmed wide by David Raya. The Arsenal keeper also blocked a Jamal Musiala shot a minute later as Bayern had a brief spell of pressure in the first half.\n\nThe best chance, however, fell to Arsenal in the 32nd with Gabriel Martinelli's first-time shot, after good work from Martin \u00d8degaard, going straight to keeper Manuel Neuer, who set a competition record with his 58th clean sheet.\n\nThe hosts went close straight after the restart with Leon Goretzka's header bouncing off the crossbar before Guerreiro hit the post with a shot on the rebound.\n\nBut they gradually upped the pressure against a toothless Arsenal and Kimmich charged into the box and drilled his header past Raya.\n\nArsenal coach Mikel Arteta made several substitutions but they could not find a way into the opposition box and had no real scoring chances in the second half with Bayern remaining disciplined and in control of the game.\n\n\"Very sad and disappointed with the final result,\" Arteta said. \"It was a tie of very small margins. In the first leg we conceded two poor goals.\n\n\"It was a game where you can see an error or individual brilliance would make the difference. The goal put them in a really good position. We lacked the magic to unlock the game and open that door. That's why we are out.\"\n\nThe defeat caps a disappointing four days for Arteta's team after their Premier League title challenge suffered a blow with their loss to Aston Villa on Sunday."}]}

Silva's attempt was right down the middle and easily caught chest-high by Lunin.\n\nDefeat ended City's bid to become the first English team to win back-to-back Champions League titles and their pursuit of successive trebles. City are still challenging for the Premier League title and the FA Cup.\n\nVictory for Madrid keeps the Spanish giant in the hunt for a record-extending 15th European Cup. It also saw them advance to the semifinals for the fourth year in row -- denying City the chance to emulate that feat.\n\nBut Madrid had to dig in to get past Pep Guardiola's team, which dominated the majority of the match without managing to add to De Bruyne's second-half goal.\n\nThis was the third straight season Madrid and City have clashed in European club soccer's most demanding competition.\n\nIt has become a classic rivalry with the winner of their meetings going on to win the competition in each of the past two years -- a measure of the fine margins between the teams that they entered this match with nothing separating them after drawing the first leg.\n\nMadrid were out for revenge after being routed 4-0 in the semifinals last year. Despite coming up against the defending champions and tournament favorites, Jude Bellingham was quick to point out the pedigree of his own team on the eve of the match, noting, \"We're a pretty good team ourselves.\"\n\nBellingham was pivotal to Madrid's opener with a moment of brilliance to open City up.\n\nCollecting a high ball just past the halfway line, the England midfielder shook off the attention of Rodri with a deft touch to wrong-foot his opponent.\n\nThe ball was worked to Vin\u00edcius Junior on the right, who crossed to Rodrygo. Rodrygo's first shot was pushed away by \u00c9derson, but there was nothing City's goalkeeper could do when he fired home on the rebound.\n\nIn response, Erling Haaland and City mounted one attack after another to leave Madrid retreating for the majority of regulation time.\n\nJack Grealish had numerous chances to level the score, while Nacho had to clear from just in front of the line under pressure from Haaland. Phil Foden saw another effort stopped by Lunin.\n\nCity's pressure eventually paid off when De Bruyne leveled the game.\n\nSubstitute J\u00e9r\u00e9my Doku's cross was only partially blocked by R\u00fcdiger and when the ball rolled to De Bruyne, he lifted a shot high into the net.\n\nHe almost put the home team ahead moments later with a long-range effort that just went over, and he missed the target again shortly after from inside the box.\n\nR\u00fcdiger came closest to scoring in the first half of extra time when he fired over from close range, but he made amends with the winning penalty."}]}

Instead, it was Bayern who scored two minutes later with a solo effort and shot from Sane for a deserved equaliser.\n\nTheir comeback was complete in the 57th when Jamal Musiala was brought down by Lucas V\u00e1zquez and Kane sent Andriy Lunin the wrong way to put the home side ahead.\n\nReal, chasing a 15th European Cup, levelled in the 83rd with Vin\u00edcius' penalty to set up a mouth-watering return leg in Madrid next week.\n\n\"Everything we're fighting for is in this competition,\" said Kane. \"We've just got to find a way to get it done. Real Madrid away is going to be tough but we've got to go there with full belief and go for the win.\n\n\"The Champions League is the biggest of them all.

We ran a lot, but that's necessary in a game like this.\n\n\"You have to earn your way to Wembley. All we need now is a draw in the second leg, but we also want to win next week.\"\n\nThe win also confirmed Germany will get a fifth qualifying spot for next season's Champions League, with Dortmund being the main beneficiaries at the moment, sitting in fifth place in the Bundesliga with three games left to play.\n\nDortmund went close just before half-time with Marcel Sabitzer, but his shot was blocked by Donnaruma. The French side improved after the break and went agonisingly close to an equaliser in the 52nd minute with Mbappe curling a shot onto the far post and then Achraf Hakimi also hitting the woodwork on the rebound.\n\n\"We saw an even match with two teams that play good football when they have the ball,\" Luis Enrique told a press conference on Wednesday.\n\n\"We both created many scoring chances. This time our opponents scored and we didn't. The result reflects how close the game was.\"\n\nFour minutes later Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz saw his stooping header sail wide after being left completely unmarked in the box before Dortmund keeper Gregor Kobel kept out Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9's close range effort in the 71st.\n\nDortmund, winners in 1997 and looking to reach their first final since 2013, soaked up the pressure as PSG's Vitinha narrowly missed the target 10 minutes later.\n\n\"In the last two rounds, they had the home game as their second game, whereas it was the other way round for us,\" Luis Enrique added. \"Now it's a different and new scenario, we'll have the crowd on our side in the second leg.\n\n\"I would have liked to create the chances we have created, but you have to be effective to score. We'll see what version we show in Paris.\""}]}

At the beginning nobody thought we would go that far. We're out in the semifinals but with a new coach and a new project.\"\n\nDortmund coach Edin Terzic said his team deserved their place in the final.\n\n\"I am very proud, very happy. We beat PSG and we kept a clean sheet. We had a bit of luck but we deserve to go to the final,\" he said.\n\nLuis Enrique's team, who entered the tie as favourites to reach their second final after they finished as runners-up in 2020, made an aggressive start and Mbapp\u00e9 had their first chance in the seventh minute with a half-volley as the hosts piled on the pressure.\n\nWith Mbapp\u00e9 on the left flank and Gon\u00e7alo Ramos as a lone striker, the France forward had some space out wide and the possibility to cut in and threaten the Dortmund goal.\n\nThe visitors, however, were composed and held firm. Their confidence grew and they had their first opportunity through Julian Ryerson, whose shot hit the side netting.\n\nDortmund had a better chance in the 35th when, after a sharp counter attack following a woeful Mbapp\u00e9 miss, Gianluigi Donnarumma pulled off a brilliant save to deny Karim Adeyemi.\n\nPSG were lucky the score on the night was level at halftime.\n\nLuis Enrique's side stepped up a gear after the break with Warren Za\u00efre Emery's shot hitting the outside of the post after Mbapp\u00e9's attempt was deflected into his path by Ramos.\n\nBut Dortmund were more clinical as Hummels headed home from a corner five minutes after the interval to double the German side's advantage over the two legs.\n\nRamos's shot on the turn then went just over and Nuno Mendes's 25-metre missile hit the post as PSG reacted swiftly.\n\nAnother Mbapp\u00e9 attempt was deflected onto the bar before Vitinha's powerful shot also hit the woodwork.\n\nPSG's Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 was a constant threat after the hour mark but, just like the rest of the team, the France forward came more into the game far too late against a side who never lost their composure and fully deserve their place in the final."}]}
